									<p>Providing logistics services on an international scale makes Polar Logistics Group <span>very aware of its ecological responsibility</span>.</p>
									<p>As an environmentally aware company, <span>we are committed to protecting nature and maintaining a safe ecological environment</span>. Our approach to reducing the environmental impact corresponds with our <span>think local and act global</span> business philosophy; it starts at the office desk with recycling and making more efficient use of paper and the many other resources we use every day.
									</p>
									<p>When developing individually tailored logistics solutions for our customers, we also consider the ecological aspects and try to implement the most environmentally friendly procedures.</p>
									<p>
										<span>To systematically keep the environmental</span> impact as low as possible, we strive to improve our logistics operations and processes through technical innovation. As an example, our recent ecological sustainability project included	the partial and gradual conversion of our vehicle fleet to fuel-saving models that have been converted to run on liquid petroleum gas (LPG).
